<h1>New political party in APHS moves towards school changes.</h1>
<p>The new student Freedom Party are going to make Arthur Phillip a better school through caring for the physical and mental well-being of the students in this community. Arthur Phillip High School is located in Parramatta, in Sydney’s west. The Student Freedom Party is campaigning throughout May and their election will be held in late June.<br></br>

The Student Freedom Party has released a statement calling for improvements in the Arthur Phillip school system. As students, we spend a significant amount of time in school every day, and believe that a lack of health and wellbeing can impact their performance in school. The release identifies several areas of concern, including the state of school bathrooms, the lift ban policy, and unjust choices made by some teachers.<br></br>

According to our leader, Henry, “Our school is a community, we help with one another and improve the wellbeing of each other. We must put in the EFFORT, and COMMITMENT to create a change for our school to set onto the right path in a healthy environment. We are determined to give this school the change it deserves.” <br></br>

The party also takes issue with the current policies on school lifts, stating that the safety of students should be a top priority. They believe that the lift ban policy is unjustified, and that overcrowding has only been an issue due to lift maintenance issues and a private lift exclusive for teachers.<br></br>

"We urge our teachers to take heed of our concerns and address them promptly," said a member of the party, Ayush, for the Student Freedom Party. "As students, we have the right to a hygienic environment conducive to learning."<br></br>

Our Student Freedom Party is a group of students dedicated to improving conditions at Arthur Phillip school. Their objectives include improving the physical and mental wellbeing of students, promoting equality and fairness, and creating a safe and secure environment for learning.

The party hopes that their call to action will bring about positive change at Arthur Phillip school.</p></body>
